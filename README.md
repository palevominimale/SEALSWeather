# SEALSWeather

This is my training project.
A simple weather forecast app for Android. Contains a lot of bugs and crashes, but generally works... stable.

Planned (in order of decreasing relevance):
- improve widget update algorithm
- stable background updating
- weather alerts
- improve location detection functionality
- ability to choose a city
- light theme
